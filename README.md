## discordjs-ext

A possibly useless minimal abstraction of the (discord.js)[https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js] library for making bots. Sort of Inspired by ((discord.ext).py)[https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master/discord/ext]
Upon further additions, seeks to replace (discord.js-commando)[https://github.com/discordjs/Commando]
